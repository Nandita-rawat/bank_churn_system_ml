The data set contains information valuable to predict a bank's churn rate. The data contains 10000 records and 18 columns.




Summary of Findings

i.    The Bank has a moderately young age distribution with adults (26-40) and young adults (18-25) making up a total of 64% of the Bank's customer base population.

ii    The Bank approximately has 20% churn rate with middle age adults (41-60) accounting for the majority of the  Bank's churn.

iii.  Customers with a one-year tenure have the highest churn rate (23%). It is recommended that the Bank strengthens its onboarding programmes for new clients and measure the effectiveness.

iv.   Analysis shows that customers with 2 bank products churn the lowest (8%) with higher amounts of product resulting to a 80-100% churn rate. To counter the effect, the bank should review/strengthen its product offering, incentivize bundle product packages, provide personalised product services and measure its effectiveness.

v.    Germany has the highest churn rate by geography (32%); The Bank needs to understand the common complaints amongst their customers in Germany and replicate the customer experience and customer success initiatives done in France and Spain.  

vi.   Analysis shows that the average account balance of a customer reduces as the number of products increases. The impact is more pronounced on retained customers than their churned counterpart.  

vii.  An active customer is less likely to churn.  

viii. Retained customers have a relatively higher credit score than their churned counterpart. 

ix.   Based on the filtering criteria, 1176 customers qualify and should be advised to own a credit card as they are potentially at risk to churn. 

x.    Further investigation can be carried out on 337 churned customers who qualified but did not own a credit card. This will help the Bank identify factors that determines churn. 

xi.   The Bank needs to improve its satisfaction score across board as the average satisfaction score shows that customers are neutral
